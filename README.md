# pinoyreactor

A 2-player mobile game built using HTML, CSS and jQuery, and then compiled with [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com).

This is my attempt in recreating the popular game called [2 Player Reactor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coolcherrytrees.games.reactor&hl=en) using
non-native code that can support cross-platform deployment.

The game features Filipino-inspired Q&A trivia. So if you're Filipino, you will find this interesting to play.
